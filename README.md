# know-thyself
Writing game aimed to know oneself

It’s about developing a game from scratch that helps with self-awareness.
It’s composed of daily questions or prompts. Each prompt encourages the user to complete a short writing exercise. The exercise should be short, doable, the user should learn something about themselves.

We’ll start with a bank of 30 questions.
The game will take place in Hebrew (future instances might be in other languages).
