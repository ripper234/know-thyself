# know-thyself
Writing game aimed to know oneself

It’s about developing a game from scratch that helps with self-awareness.
It’s composed of daily questions or prompts. Each prompt encourages the user to complete a short writing exercise. The exercise should be short, doable, the user should learn something about themselves.

We’ll start with a bank of 30 questions.
The game will take place in Hebrew (future instances might be in other languages).


TODO
* Project Name
* Define Purpose
  * Make something I enjoy playing in v0.1 + iterate on
  * Slowly add features to attract other users
* Should I market it first?
  * Purpose: to find early users
  * Post on Facebook
  * Prep Google Form
  * Open whatsapp/facebook group?


Spec
----

Website is modeled like xkcd. The / website is the "daily question". You can go back/forward to view past questions. URL structure models XKCD (https://xkcd.com/3197/).

Every page is easily sharable to facebook/social.

Every page is a question (from a fixed pre-generated and curated list of daily questions). The user can answer.
A user can save annonymously which doesn't really save but rather prompts them to login (via Facebook connect).

Principle: A user can only answer TODAY's question, they cannot save answers to past questions.
(This is done to do a FOMO effect and have users come back every day).

There is some sort of upvote mechanism for ANSWERS. (every user can upvote every answer other than their own)

TODO: What flavor would the upvote mechanism have? (plus, thumb up, a unique icon...)

A user can favorite (star) specific answers (from others & their own). They can access all answers they favoriated.
They can also favorite questions.

When an answer is shared, this creates a well-formatted Facebook post with interesting content.

TODO - should the full text of the answer be posted, or just a teaser - enough to make users click?

Every question has a unique image generated that captures the essence of the question in a unique way.
Conductive to sharing it on Facebook.
