# Most Important Tasks:
1. Write questions
2. Choose who to invite (DM)
3. Prep Whatsapp bot to run the game via Group and/or DMs (via Dopamine?).


# know-thyself
Writing game aimed to know oneself

Positioning
-----------
This is a **daily writing game**, not a coach.
The primary value is showing up daily and writing.
GPT, when present, plays a minor reflective role only.

First Principles
----------------
1. Spec-driven-development. Spec is THE source of truth. Perhpas to the extreme "code is not stored in store control (other than as a cache)".
1. A. TODO - research - is this feasible? Current research says "no".
1. B. TODO - toolchain - what toolchain do I need that supports this? What's a MUST? What's OPTIONAL?
2. MVP/v0.1 = something that I (Ron) enjoy playing with over time.
2. A. Once I am a consistent user, I'll naturally add features and improve.
2. B. MVP/v1.0 = something X other users try out (A) and convert to weekly users (B)   

Tooling
-------
1. Github *documentation* as source of truth
2. Copy-paste Readme.md to ChatGPT. Generate diffs and apply (manually/automatically)

TODO

1. Must find tooling that read the entire repo and apply diffs. Clawdbot? 
1. A. Define spec of tooling. (Warning - don't get too recurive here! Only as needed. Tooling is a moving target.)

User-facing message (unlogged homepage)
 --------------------------------------
 "A private daily writing game."
 "No points. No winners."
 "Show up. Write honestly. Notice what’s there."
 
It’s composed of daily questions or prompts. Each prompt encourages the user to complete a short writing exercise. The exercise should be short, doable, the user should learn something about themselves.

We’ll start with a bank of 30 questions.
The game will take place in Hebrew (future instances might be in other languages).

Spec
----

Website is modeled like xkcd. The / website is the "daily question". You can go back/forward to view past questions. URL structure models XKCD (https://xkcd.com/3197/).

Every page is sharable to Facebook/social, but sharing is limited to the QUESTION only.

Every page is a question (from a fixed pre-generated and curated list of daily questions). The user can answer.

Users can start answering before signup.
Answers are treated as a **local draft** until finalized.
To keep an answer, the user must log in.
The primary action button is **“Finalize”**. (TODO - "submit"? Something else?)
The answer input includes a one-time placeholder text inviting writing and signaling privacy (copy TBD).

Principle: A user can only answer TODAY's question, they cannot save answers to past questions.
(This is done to do a FOMO effect and have users come back every day).

TODO: What flavor would the upvote mechanism have? (plus, thumb up, a unique icon...)

A user can favorite (star) specific questions (from others & their own). They can access all questions they favorited.

Sharing never includes answer content. Shared posts include the question and the unique question graphics. We let the user add their own thoughts (or not).

TODO - should the full text of the question be posted, or just a teaser - enough to make users click?

Every question has a unique image generated that captures the essence of the question in a unique way.
Conductive to sharing it on Facebook.

Login
------
Via Facebook connect + Google
TODO - is this the right choice & order?
 
Weekly Reflection
-----------------
At the end of every week (Friday for Israel), the user is shown a private view of their answers from the past 7 days.
(The websites rests or offer a peaceful mini quote on Saturday, no writing task)

The user is invited to write a *weekly summary* that synthesizes the week.
This summary is written manually (never auto-generated from answers).

Weekly summaries are **private by default**.
The user may explicitly opt-in to make a weekly summary public. This opt-in is always on the current weekly update, never a general setting.

Weekly summaries may be shared publicly, and only after explicit opt-in.

Internal contract (design / dev)
--------------------------------
- This is a solo daily game, not coaching. Insight comes from repetition and patterns, never from judgment, scoring, or comparison.
- Privacy is the default and the rule. Daily answers are sacred; sharing happens only through deliberate synthesis or questions.
- GPT is a mirror, not an authority. It may reflect continuity or patterns, but never evaluate, praise, direct, or rank.


Content
-------
TODO: What content would
A) be interesting specifically to me (Ron Gross).
B) would be suitable to post on facebook daily
C) Would generate some compelling posts that cause 1. FB engagement 2. Website visits

GenAI Usage
-----------
- Light reflection on finalized answers
- Long-term continuity & growth across a user’s journey
- Initial list of *curated* questions
- image generated for every question
- image generated in every weekly reflection

Marketing
---------

Posting flow:
1. Post to Facebook
2. Add link to archive
3. Post link to Whatsapp group

KPIs:
1. Setup reminder/agent to measure these!
2. Setup monthly/quarterly goals
3. Metrics:
3. A. Engagement on Facebook
4. B. Whatsapp group user count
5. C. Website metrics - TODO


TODO
- First post
  - Decide on conditions for first post
  - Discuss it in therapy (conflicting needs. "build in public" vs "don't overhype/spread yourself thin - build first")
  - Open whatsapp group
  - Write first blog post
  - Review it
  - Decide on a posting frequency (after every major work chunk/day or weekly)
  - Post it
- Getting info from users (forms/polls/when/what)


General
-------
TODO
1. Find a name & domain for the project.
2. Cleanup this readmad
2. A. Move TODOs to issues (once we have a tool that can read that)
2. B. General refactor
3. Process /research folder and extract insights/issues.
4. Generate candidate first 30 questions. Brainstorm style/prompt first. Hebrew.
5.
