First Blog draft.

Hello World
My personal journey. Follow on whatsapp.
Nothing interests me. My bipolar. The gap of creating anything is too large, so I give up in advance. Trying to extract a core principle: MVP should be EASY and FUN FOR ME. Once I get that, loop. That's how I built Fredo.ai.
A confusing world with dev agents, many options, and promises. Some broken ones. The feeling of "we're almost there but not quite" (Maybe be 1-2-5 years till we're 'there'). What is "there". Wish Machine. *Pure Spec-driven-development*. Attempting it.
I might hire people to work on it. Might do it purely agent.

If you have anything to contribute, especially on methodology, speak up.

I'm pysched! But In ~ a week or two, I'll be depressed and zero motivation. Be patient with me. My hope is that the unit of work is small enough so I can regain context easily on next UP, and build from iteration to iteration.

What I'm building - a game of self-awareness. Private-first. Some social elements. GPT convinced me that most user updates should be private. Echos my own journey with just being an empty "pipe". I learned I must process internally & privately first. But also trying to combine my insight with Fredo - ultra Build in Public. Not just pretty announcements. Share the pain.

I don't know what I'm doing. I'm brainstorming with Github and ChatGPT... and hoping something workable will come out of this. Hopefully, also a Spec-driven-developemnt process as well. (I also think in Meta, I can't just do problem X, I have to simultaniously think on how to improve the "process for solving X").
